## Abstract

&emsp;&emsp;Macrophages are immune cells with the ability to engulf cells and digest them by a process known as phagocytosis. While their roles in immune defense, homeostasis, cancer, and regeneration are well known, this project sought to understand the fundamental molecular/cellular mechanisms within a particular family of cytokines -- interleukin-17 (IL-17). The unique extracorporeal vasculature of the model organism, Botryllus schlosseri, was exploited to dissect the mechanisms of these cells during two opposing vascular remodeling events: Vascular regression and Vascular regeneration, using RNA/protein bioinformatics. We discovered through RNA sequencing data that IL-17 ligand expression was greatest during the early late stages of vascular regeneration, and early stages of vascular regression, whereas the receptors were consistently expressed. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis coupled with the genomic location of IL-17 revleaed that several IL-17 members are a result of gene duplication which is a precursor for the evolution of interleukins. This study helped to elucidate the ability of macrophages to transform into either inflammatory or anti-inflammatory under a given condition. 

## *Botryllus schlosseri* Blastogenetic Cycle 
*Botryllus schlosseri* undergoes a week long blastogenetic cycle, regenerating its entire body *de novo*. It is a well choreographed dance of regenerating and regressing vasculature. We hypothesized that this process was aided by the immunoregulatory family of proteins, IL-17. Given the translucent nature of the extracorporeal vasculature, this 27 second long timeplapse captures the process.
