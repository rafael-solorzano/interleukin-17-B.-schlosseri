## Abstract

Macrophages are immune cells with the ability to engulf cells and digest them by a process known as phagocytosis. While their roles in immune defense, homeostasis, cancer, and regeneration are well known, we still need to understand the fundamental molecular/cellular mechanisms behind these functions. The unique extracorporeal vasculature of the model organism, Botryllus schlosseri, will be exploited to dissect the mechanisms of these cells during two opposing vascular remodeling events: Vascular regression and Vascular regeneration, using RNA/protein bioinformatics. This study will help elucidate the ability of macrophages to transform into either inflammatory or anti-inflammatory under a given condition.
